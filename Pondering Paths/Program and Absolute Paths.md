# Program and Absolute Paths
In this module we learn about absolute paths for programs
The challenge was to invoke the `run` program under the `challenege` directory which was under the `root` directory.
Therfore the absolute path of `run` is one that starts from `root` and ends at `run`.
Thus we invoke `/challenge/run`, which gives success to the challenge and unlocks the flag.
```

hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{k939WvZNSNYYmVyX0__cx0t4_sw.dVDN1QDLzIzN0czW}
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$
```
