# Setting PATH
Like the previously challenge, we change the `PATH` again, this time just to a specific directory which contains the `win` command to unlock the flag.
```
Connected!
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ PATH="/challenge/more_commands/"
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ /challenge/run
Invoking 'win'....
Congratulations! You properly set the flag and 'win' has launched!
