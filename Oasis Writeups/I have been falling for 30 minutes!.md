# I have been falling for 30 minutes!
In this challenge we're transported to a website `https://firewall.oasis.cryptonite.live`.
Upon clicking next we're redirected to `https://firewall.oasis.cryptonite.live/users?userid=1` and then to `https://firewall.oasis.cryptonite.live/users?userid=2` and so on until `https://firewall.oasis.cryptonite.live/users?userid=5`
Here we don't get the chance to move to the next page, so we play around and isnpect the website but its of no use, so we try changing the website link manually after noticing the pattern of changing userid. 
We change the link to `https://firewall.oasis.cryptonite.live/users?userid=6` and thus capture the flag.
