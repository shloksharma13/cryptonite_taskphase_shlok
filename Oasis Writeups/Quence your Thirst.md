# Quence your thirst
We use a caeser decoder, an enigma decoder and a lot of decoders but none work. 
Then we try the substitution cipher on `https://www.dcode.fr/substitution-cipher` and put `DLLWB` as `HTTPS` and then by a domino effect, words start to make sense.
We decipher all except the words `qzjx` now we try all the permutation combinations of these and enter them one by one and get the code.
