# Stairway to Heaven
In this challenge we're given a file named `game`. We play around with it and put it on file openers online and find out that its a linux executable file.
Then we dual boot onto our ubuntu and download this file there. We loacte the file and find its directory.
Then I follow the commands from wikiHow and use `sudo chmod +x game` followed by `sudo ./game` to run the file.
This generates a multicolor print which we copy and paste into notepad.
This multicolor text then turns into characters, where I find a series of numbers that looks like ASCII and upon conversion we capture the flag.
