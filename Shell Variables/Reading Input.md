# Reading Input
In this challenge we learn how to use the `read` command to take input from the user and directly store it into a variable.
Thus we use it to input the value `COLLEGE` into `PWN` variable and unlock the flag.
```
Connected!
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read -p "INPUT: " PWN
INPUT: COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{kcn0WgJ6ZK_P-QtzkRKzMzyDBhD.dhzN1QDLzIzN0czW}
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$
