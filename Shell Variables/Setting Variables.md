# Setting Variables
In this challenge, we learn how to set a value to a variable. We're told to set the value of `PWN` to `COLLEGE`. So we use `PWN=COLLEGE` to unlock the flag.
```
Connected!
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{ctJbnGAIuSAYTFIPjE9E7botD5K.dlTN1QDLzIzN0czW}
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$
