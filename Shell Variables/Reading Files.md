# Reading Files
In this challenge we combine whatever we have learnt yet to use the `read` command and redirect the output of `/challenge/read_me` as the input for `PWN`.
```
Connected!
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN < /challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{ISp6AUhN2ateD2ymU0okloztrEL.dBjM4QDLzIzN0czW}
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$
```
